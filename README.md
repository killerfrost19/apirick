Steps to run application locally:

1. Download Node.js
2. Make sure you have a code editor like Visual studio code
3. Pull the code from github repository
4. Go to the directory and install the necessary libraries (for this project , I used axios, mui/material , mui/icons-material, 
   react-router-dom )
   Ex: I have used Material UI so install it using  command "npm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material"
5. Type" npm start" command and it will open the application in localhost:3000/character

I have also deployed the app , please visit : https://r4j3vr.csb.app/character ( This is before I implemented pagination ,but now the source code has pagination option too)
